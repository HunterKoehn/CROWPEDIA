					<h4>Finding Crows Near You.</h4>
					<p>
						The great thing about crows is that they are everywhere! You see crows in the sky all of the time, pass 1 or 3 in a little pudding taking a bath,
						on power lines or on a store's roof. You don't have to look hard to find a group of crows wherever you may be! They are usually used to being around
						people as well and so you don't have to tread carefully in order to get close. There are some spots that have more crows due to them having access to food or
						a high up spot where others of their kind like to congregate. Some people do not get out much but want to see crows more,
						we will discuss tactics to allure them to your home in the "What You Can Do From Home" section on this page.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="feed">
					<h4>What Food Can You Give to Crows?</h4>
					<p>
						Crows are omnivores and will generally eat whatever they can get. Their diets can consist of many different things such as: fruits and seeds,
						insects, fish, small mammals, human food, bird eggs and other birds(believe it or not). This is good for us as we can usually just throw whatever
						we have and they will accept it. One good tactic is to carry around sunflower seeds with you in a baggy and you can throw it their way whenever you see fit.
						If you want to play to your strengths, then you can go for peanuts as they are typically seen to be a crow's favorite! One really neat trick you can do
						to be well on your way to having a group of crows befriended is feeding at regular intervals. What this means is that say you go on a walk every day
						at a certain time. Bring food with you for the crows and feed them every time you go on said walk. This works great because crows can easily remember
						a face and they are smart enough to know that they get food around said time and so they will naturally come then. This assures that every time you
						go walking, there will be some crows waiting for you and the delicious food you bring!
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="friend">
					<h4>How to Befriend Them</h4>
					<p>
						The last section plays in to this one greatly. It is only natural that the best way to befriend a non-domesticated animal is via food! While crows will generally
						eat anything, they still have tastebuds and therefore preferences. If you are targetting a single crow then you can use different foods and by process of
						elimination, find their preference. Never approach crows at high speeds or making noises. They prefer quiet areas and random sounds can spook them away.
						Feeding routines also discussed in the last section are very benefitial for the friend making process but ultimately keep some distance as you want to slowly
						build up that trust. Crows can hold grudges and are great at remembering faces so be careful out there!
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="home">
					<h4>What You Can Do From Home</h4>
					<p>
						Want to hang out with crows in the comfort of your own home? Look no further, we've got you covered!
						Firstly, crows, as we have said like quiet spots so wind chimes, bells and whistles all should go. Also an essential to having any and all birds
						in your backyard is of course a bird bath! This is so they can drink water or just take a bath to cool off. Just having these two things will increase
						the chances of crows in your backyard tremendously! This all is very general though and you will most likely get other birds. To target crows
						specifically we will have to do more. You can install a long horizontal pole for them to get a good view of the area, crows like little observatory
						spots such as these. Crows are also very social creatures too so if you are still not getting anything, you can put fake crows in your yard in order to
						attract the real ones! With all of these things and food at regular intervals, your life will be filled with crows and you just might be able to further interact
						with some if they let you!
