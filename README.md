# CROWPEDIA

CROWPEDIA is pretty much a wiki about crows.

It has information on:
  where to find them
  what to feed them
  how to befriend them
  and what you can do from home
 
There is also a discord I made that you can join through the website as well as a contact us page

the crow gallery is a page on the site with pictures to all of the crows found in the US and links to pages with more information on them.
